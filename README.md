# Abstract: 
Imagine a world where healthcare professionals possess a powerful tool in their quest to safeguard the health of newborns. A world where cutting-edge technology seamlessly integrates with clinical expertise to provide accurate and timely insights. In the realm of neonatal care, the analysis of skin colour plays a crucial role in detecting potential health conditions. However, deciphering the subtle variations and
indicators within neonatal skin colour is an intricate task, prone to human error and misdiagnosis. This is where the advent of an Intelligence Decision Support System (IDSS) becomes a game-changer, revolutionizing the way we approach neonatal care. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and data analytics, an IDSS offers a sophisticated solution, empowering healthcare professionals with precise assessments and informed decision-making. This project involves an extensive literature analysis, employ image filtering and analysis techniques, utilize neonate segmentation via the Segment Anything Model (SAM), incorporate Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for image preprocessing, and leverage image augmentation. These preparatory steps culminate in the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying neonatal jaundice. Despite challenges stemming from lighting variations, dataset limitations, and skin tone representation, the findings underscore the potential of AI-enhanced tools, showcasing training and testing accuracies of 0.88 and 0.84, and an AUC of 0.94 respectively.
