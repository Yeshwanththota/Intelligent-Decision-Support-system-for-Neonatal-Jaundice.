Research: Intelligent Decision Support system for Neonatal Jaundice.
Neonatal Jaundice Classification using CNN and Image processing.

Abstract: 
Imagine a world where healthcare professionals possess a powerful tool in their quest
to safeguard the health of newborns. A world where cutting-edge technology seamlessly integrates with clinical expertise to provide accurate and timely insights. In
the realm of neonatal care, the analysis of skin colour plays a crucial role in detecting potential health conditions. However, deciphering the subtle variations and
indicators within neonatal skin colour is an intricate task, prone to human error and
misdiagnosis. This is where the advent of an Intelligence Decision Support System
(IDSS) becomes a game-changer, revolutionizing the way we approach neonatal care.
By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and data analytics, an IDSS offers
a sophisticated solution, empowering healthcare professionals with precise assessments and informed decision-making. This project involves an extensive literature
analysis, employ image filtering and analysis techniques, utilize neonate segmentation via the Segment Anything Model (SAM), incorporate Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for image preprocessing, and leverage image
augmentation. These preparatory steps culminate in the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying neonatal jaundice. Despite
challenges stemming from lighting variations, dataset limitations, and skin tone representation, the findings underscore the potential of AI-enhanced tools, showcasing
training and testing accuracies of 0.88 and 0.84, and an AUC of 0.94 respectively.
